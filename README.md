# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and resources for an end-to-end machine learning project. The project aims to build a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms and provide a complete workflow from data ingestion to model deployment.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset used for training and testing.
- `src/`: Directory containing the source code for the project.
    - `components/`: Directory for project components/modules.
        - `data_ingestion.py`: Module for data ingestion and preprocessing.
        - `model_trainer.py`: Module for training and evaluating machine learning models.
    - `utils.py`: Utility functions used in the project.
    - `exception.py`: Custom exception classes for error handling.
    - `logger.py`: Logging configuration for the project.
- `artifacts/`: Directory to store the trained model and other artifacts.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the entire workflow of the project.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Revanthraja/MLProject.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Place the dataset file in the `data/` directory.
2. Configure the project settings in `config.py` if necessary.
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`
4. The script will perform data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and save the trained model in the `artifacts/` directory.
5. The evaluation metrics and other information will be logged to the console and stored in a log file.
6. You can use the trained model for predictions or deploy it in your desired environment.

## Configuration

The project can be customized by modifying the settings in `config.py`. The configuration file contains parameters such as dataset file paths, model hyperparameters, and logging settings.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- xgboost
- catboost
- etc.

The complete list of dependencies and their versions can be found in `requirements.txt`.
